## Test Structure
- Write tests alongside the code they test
- Group tests logically with describe blocks
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

## Test Coverage
- Test critical user flows and edge cases
- Create snapshot tests for UI components
- Test error handling and fallback states
- Create integration tests for complex workflows
- Test different device sizes and orientations
- Test for accessibility issues in component tests
- Implement E2E tests with Detox for critical paths

## Best Practices
- Use Jest for utility function tests
- Use React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Use test-driven development for complex features
- Create proper test fixtures and factories
- Implement mock services for API and native module tests
