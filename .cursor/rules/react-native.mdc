## Architecture
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Use proper error boundaries for components that fetch data
- Handle platform-specific code with Platform.OS or platform-specific file extensions

## UI/UX
- Ensure UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- Use proper keyboard handling with KeyboardAvoidingView and dismissKeyboard
- Prefer FlatList or SectionList over ScrollView for long lists
- Implement responsive layouts with flex components

## Performance
- Test on both iOS and Android regularly during development
- Use Expo's optimized APIs when available
- Leverage Reanimated and Gesture Handler for animations and interactions

## Project Specifics
- Use components from the components folder whenever possible
- Integrate with NativeWind for styling (see styling.mdc)
- Implement safe area management for notches and dynamic island
