- First, create a new file in the @/lib/icons/ directory with the name of the LucideIcon.
- Then, in each file:
    - Import the Icon from LucideIcon
    - Import the iconWithClassName function
    - Call the iconWithClassName function and pass the icon as its argument
    - Export the Icon
- Example:
```
import { Home } from "lucide-react-native";

import { iconWithClassName } from "./iconWithClassName";
iconWithClassName(Home);
export { Home };
```
- Then, when importing/referring to the icon in other files, try to use NativeWind classes to define both light and dark mode colors

## Implementation
- Use vector icons from @expo/vector-icons when possible
- Create reusable Icon components for consistent usage
- Ensure proper accessibility with accessibilityLabel
- Use appropriate size and color based on design system

## Performance
- Import icons individually to reduce bundle size
- Create custom SVG icons for app-specific needs
- Optimize SVGs by removing unnecessary details
