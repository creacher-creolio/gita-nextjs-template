## Structure
- Use React Navigation as the navigation library
- Implement Stack, Tab, and Drawer navigation as needed
- Organize navigation in a dedicated navigation/ directory
- Create type-safe route names with TypeScript

## Implementation
- Use navigation hooks (useNavigation, useRoute) instead of props
- Pass minimal data through route params
- Implement deep linking for important screens
- Handle authentication flows with proper navigation guards

## UX/Performance
- Add transition animations for navigation actions
- Implement proper loading states during navigation
- Prefetch data for anticipated navigation targets
- Use header buttons with proper touch feedback
