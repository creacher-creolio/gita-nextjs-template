## Implementation
- Use Pressable instead of TouchableOpacity for better control
- Add haptic feedback for important interactions (react-native-haptic-feedback)
- Include visual feedback with opacity/scale changes on press
- Use onPressIn for header buttons (Stack.Screen options headerRight)

## Accessibility
- Add accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint to interactive elements
- Set proper accessibilityRole (button, link, etc.)
- Make touch targets minimum 44Ã—44 points
- Use hitSlop to expand touchable area of small elements

## Best Practices
- Debounce rapid presses to prevent double submissions
- Disable buttons during loading states with visual indicators
- Add ripple effect on Android and opacity changes on iOS
- Implement proper loading states during async operations
