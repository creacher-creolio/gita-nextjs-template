# PNPM

## Installation

Must use pnpm 9.15.5 in order for expo to work even though the latest pnpm version is higher:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@9.15.5
```

## pnpm vs. npm

- Use `pnpm` for package management instead of npm. It's faster and has better dependency management: <https://pnpm.io/>

## Development Workflow

- Use PowerShell for terminal commands on Windows
- Check for type issues after making changes
