# Legend State

## Why Legend State?

- we actually love Zustand, and find Legend State to be slightly more complex, but we like it because it's local first and integrates well with Supabase. It's also supposedly the fastest state manager.

## State Management

- Use React hooks for local state
- Use Legend State for global state (as per project setup)
- Prefer server state management for data fetching
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
